First, I will analyze the educational/income dataset to determine which neighborhoods in Pittsburgh are the _\"oldest\"_ and _\"richest\"_, since that demographic of people would be perfect to mug. They are less likely to do any bodily damage to you should they fight back, and they have a lot of money; these factors would make these neighborhoods prime targets for muggings."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"FE_4WckCfX4i"},"source":["## Education/Income Dataset\n","\n","The first dataset, [_\"Education-Income 2010\"_](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/pgh/resource/f7b19c6c-aa66-419b-b0e1-9998d7ddfcbc), provides us several important pieces of data for each neighborhood: average education obtained for each age group, average income for each age group, and the estimated percentage of the neighborhood under the poverty line. All of these will provide useful information from which we can draw conclusions."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"jRWaWamxgr5G","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1617483939376,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":186,"user":{"displayName":"Alejandro Ciuba","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjsmuQEr0i4xMpm9q56Qqmk84vA74U1_53-qQnJ=s64","userId":"08038255199237976900"}}},"source":["#Import the dataset from the link\n","edu_inc = pd.read_csv(\"/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/education-income.csv\") "],"execution_count":14,"outputs":[]}]}
